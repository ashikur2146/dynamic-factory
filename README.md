# Dynamic Factory

This library is overriding the default factory design pattern behavior and providing dynamic method call based on a given input data. In factory design pattern additional branching like if-else or switch-case statements are used which often seems cumbersome if there are many functional components to choose from. So, this library will take care of it based on the data provided.
