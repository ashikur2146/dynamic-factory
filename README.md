# Dynamic Factory

This library is overriding the default factory design pattern behavior and providing dynamic method call based on a given input data. In factory design pattern additional branching like if-else or switch-case statements are used which often seems cumbersome if there are many functional components to choose from. So, this library will take care of it based on the data provided.

This library is implemented using java 1.8 and will support any java version from 1.8 onwards. You can also extend its functionality and make it serve your needs within its boundary. Just a disclaimer before diving into the how to guide, this library is not available on maven central so follow the steps to add this into your current project.
